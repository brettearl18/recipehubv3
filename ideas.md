## Flexible Meal Plan Allocation for Coaches

- Allow coaches to assign a sequence of meal plans to a client (e.g., 1800 calories for 3 weeks, then 1900 for 5 weeks, etc.).
- Support custom weekly plans where coaches can allocate different calories/macros for each day of the week (e.g., higher calories on training days, lower on rest days).
- UI should make it easy to visualize and edit the plan schedule over time.
- Useful for periodized nutrition, diet breaks, or advanced coaching strategies.
